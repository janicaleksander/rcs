# Remote Command System

A distributed command-and-control platform for team management, built in Go using the actor paradigm.

---

## Overview

Remote Command System streamlines team coordination and task management through a resilient, distributed architecture.  
It provides commanders with full operational visibility while ensuring secure, real-time communication between units.

Key highlights:

- Developed a distributed command-and-control system in Go using the actor paradigm, enabling efficient management of teams with independent, fault-tolerant components.  
- Cross-platform solution: desktop app for commanders (unit/task management, real-time tracking, secure in-app messaging) and mobile app (Flutter) for members (task updates, live location sharing).  
- Integration of both platforms improved coordination, reduced task reporting delays, and ensured fast and reliable communication.  
- Designed an easy-to-manage, secure, and resilient system architecture, where each service operates independently, maintaining reliability even under partial failures.

## Features

- Distributed architecture – services run independently, improving scalability and resilience.  
- Desktop command app – for commanders: unit management, task assignment, real-time monitoring, and secure messaging.  
- Mobile client (Flutter) – for members: task updates, progress reporting, and live location tracking.  
- Real-time monitoring – continuous updates on unit activities and member locations.  
- Secure messaging – encrypted communication with guaranteed data integrity.  
- Fault tolerance – components remain operational even in case of partial system failures.
